# AGENTS.md

Agent-facing guide for this project, in the [agents.md](https://agents.md) format.
Human-facing docs live in `README.md` (front page) and the repository wiki; this
file carries the working agreements an agent needs to change the code without
breaking the project's conventions.

## Project overview

A Next.js 16 wedding website (App Router, Turbopack) with an admin panel for
content management. Black & white photography, gold accent (`#D4AF37`).
TypeScript, Tailwind 4 (CSS-based config — there is no `tailwind.config.js`),
Node 20, PostgreSQL 15. Content config is file-based JSON on a volume;
relational data (RSVPs, guest list, finances, honeymoon, seating) is
PostgreSQL. Deploys as a multi-stage Docker image to GHCR, pulled by Portainer.

## Setup commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000, /admin (password = ADMIN_PASSWORD)
npm run build      # production build
```

Local runs need a Postgres to point at — any instance will do:

```bash
docker run -d --name wed-db -e POSTGRES_USER=wed -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=wed \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=wed -p 5432:5432 postgres:15-alpine

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://wed:wed@localhost:5432/wed ADMIN_PASSWORD=dev npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` does not run `database/init.sql` (the container does, on every
boot), so apply it once by hand: `psql "$DATABASE_URL" < database/init.sql`.

The Docker dev stack (source mounted, hot reload) lives in `docker/`:

```bash
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env   # once, then edit
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

## Checks — run before calling a change done

None need a network except `check:finance:db` (live database) and
`check:finance:ui` (a browser), so they are cheap to run before a commit — and
CI runs `check:types`, `lint`, `check:photos`, `check:finance`,
`check:honeymoon`, `check:seating`, `check:schedule` and `check:offline` on every push, so a red one blocks the
image:

| Command | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `npm run check:types` | `tsc --noEmit` over the app *and* the scripts |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run check:changelog` | The changelog parser against fixtures *and* the real `CHANGELOG.md` (56 assertions) |
| `npm run check:photos` | The photo route: thumbs, resizing, 404s, the traversal guard |
| `npm run check:finance` | Budget arithmetic |
| `npm run check:finance:db` | The same against a live database |
| `npm run check:finance:ui` | The finance UI's contracts (needs a browser; fetches Playwright on demand) |
| `npm run check:offline` | 38 checks with no browser, in CI: the offline worker's routing and saving rules, staleness, and that every page in `src/app` is in the offline lists |
| `npm run check:offline:ui` | The whole site offline in a real browser, 49 checks: save, cut the server off (through a proxy), open every page, follow a link, try a save, sign out. Needs a **production build** (`BASE=… ADMIN_PASSWORD=…`) |
| `npm run check:honeymoon:ui` | The honeymoon portal in a real browser, 53 checks (none of them write): the same place panel and sections from every entry point, the itinerary toolbar staying on screen, travel on both timeline shapes, overview cards never overlapping, and at 390×844 no sideways scroll and no control under 44px on any of its pages. Needs a browser and a server with honeymoon data (`BASE=… ADMIN_PASSWORD=…`, or `DEMO=1` against the demo) |
| `npm run check:hero` | The home page's hero collapse in a real browser, at five viewport-and-input pairings — phone portrait, **phone landscape**, tablet portrait, tablet landscape, desktop — each driven by the input that device actually sends. Needs a browser and a server whose site config has a hero photo, or every case reports the placeholder instead of a pass |
| `npm run audit:finance` | A deeper sweep over the finance logic |
| `npm run check:seating` | 272 assertions with no database or browser: who takes a chair (a party member who declined takes none), seat-index allocation, where each chair sits on the canvas, moves, swaps, gathering a split party, auto-seating, the plan's own warnings, and the export — tallies, vendor plates, the grand total, the spreadsheet's columns and the one-page fit maths |
| `npm run check:honeymoon` | 743 assertions with no database or network: distances, date maths, URL parsing, the calendar grid, `.ics` output, search ranking, seed integrity, the trip-mode day resolution, sunrise/sunset, OSM opening hours, the day timeline, time zones on legs, the budget, conflicts, imports/exports, markdown, the flight parser, and journeys (layovers, day placement, door-to-door time) |

Seeds: `npm run seed:honeymoon` (bundles the Bali/Singapore travel guide,
idempotent — matches on place name, never reverts an edit) and
`npm run seed:demo -- --yes-wipe` (a completely fictional wedding;
**destructive**, demo instance only).

## The conventions that will bite you

1. **`CHANGELOG.md` is the source of truth for the version.** There is no
   version in `package.json`; the topmost `## vX.Y.Z` heading *is* the app's
   version — the admin panel's version button displays it and CI tags the
   image with it. Every substantive change gets an entry; the format, bump
   rules and traps are below, and `npm run check:changelog` enforces them.
2. **`database/init.sql` is the only committed copy of the schema.** It is
   idempotent (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` / `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`
   throughout) and the image runs it on every boot. Some tables are also — or
   only — created at runtime by their owning code (`finance_*` in
   `src/lib/financeDb.ts`, `honeymoon_*` in `src/lib/honeymoonDb.ts`,
   `donations` in its route). **If you add one of those, add it to
   `init.sql` too, or a fresh install comes up without it.** (As of v0.9.42
   `init.sql` really does hold every table, plus the `guest_list_name_unique`
   index the guest upserts need.)
3. **A travel leg's day is derived, never chosen.** `honeymoon_travel.depart_date`
   / `arrive_date` are the input; `day_id` and `arrive_day_offset` are computed
   from them by `placementFor()` in `src/lib/honeymoonJourneys.ts` and written in
   the *same* request, so a leg is never briefly filed on the wrong day.
   Everything that draws the trip — the itinerary, the calendar file, the print
   sheet, the map — still reads `day_id`/`arrive_day_offset`, so do not remove
   them; they are outputs. A leg with `journey_id IS NULL` is a journey of one,
   which is why journeys needed no migration.
4. **The hero's layout breakpoint is not an input breakpoint.** `HeroCollapse`
   renders a narrow layout and a wide one, chosen on `max-width: 768px` — but
   which *input* drives the animation is a separate question, and the wide path
   listens for touch as well as the wheel. It listened for the wheel alone until
   v0.9.104, so every touch screen wider than the breakpoint (a tablet, a phone
   on its side) had nothing listening and the hero jumped straight to the
   collage. `npm run check:hero` covers the pairings.
5. **Photos are served through `/api/photos/[filename]`, never `/photos/…`** —
   with `output: "standalone"`, files written into a volume at runtime are not
   served statically.
6. **The image name is sacred**: always
   `ghcr.io/soccerbeats/weddingwebsite:latest`, never any other name — the
   production Portainer stack is configured against it. (The demo's one-shot
   seeder is a separate image under its own name,
   `ghcr.io/soccerbeats/weddingwebsite-seeder:latest` — a different image,
   never a tag of the sacred name.)
7. **After every code change: deploy automatically — and deploying is just
   pushing.** Austin's standing instruction, overriding the older "only deploy
   when asked" gate in `deploy.md`. Push to `main`; CI builds and publishes the
   image. **Do not build and push it by hand** — two builds of the same commit
   both writing `:latest` leaves no answer to "which build is deployed". Do not
   wait to be asked.
8. **Never render your own place window — call `openPlace(id)`.** Every
   surface in the honeymoon portal opens a place through `usePlaceSheet()`
   (`PlaceSheetContext.tsx`), and the shell draws the one `PlaceSheet`. Until
   v0.10.0 there were five different windows depending on where you clicked, each
   showing a different part of the same place. Which sections show is decided by
   the place (`sheetSections()` in `src/lib/honeymoonPlaceSheet.ts`), never by the
   caller. New tabs build from `src/app/admin/honeymoon/kit/` (`TabToolbar`,
   `Segmented`, `FilterButton`, `RatingPills`, `PlaceCard`/`PlaceRow`, `Sheet`,
   `Hint`, `useTimeFormat`) rather than drawing their own — and every printed time
   goes through `useTimeFormat()`, which follows the trip's 12h/24h setting.
   `npm run check:honeymoon:ui` covers the entry points and the phone layout.
9. **Every new page goes in `src/lib/offline.ts`.** The whole site works offline
   (v0.10.3): `public/sw.js` keeps a copy of every page, its data, its photos and
   the build's code, and the installed app saves everything in the background by
   opening each listed page once in a hidden frame (the worker refuses every
   write from that frame). A page missing from `PUBLIC_PAGES` / `ADMIN_PAGES` /
   `EXCLUDED_PAGES` fails `check:offline` in CI. The worker's decisions are pure
   functions at the top of `sw.js`, tested under Node — keep them free of worker
   globals. Never let it save a redirected page (the login must never be stored
   as `/admin`), an auth route, or a non-200; never trust `navigator.onLine` for
   "am I offline" — ask `/api/offline/ping`, which the worker never answers from
   the cache. Test offline with the server truly unreachable
   (`check:offline:ui` puts a proxy in front of it): Playwright's offline switch
   does not reach a service worker's own requests, so a test that only flips it
   passes with the network still there.

### Changelog entry format

```
## vX.Y.Z — [Released|Unreleased] <title> (`branch`, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
```

- Times are **UTC** — stamp with `date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'`.
- Group changes under `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed` — the in-app
  viewer renders those three as coloured badges.
- Flip `[Unreleased]` → `[Released]` when it is pushed and deployed. Bump the
  patch on every deploy; minor/major only when Austin says so.
- **Never nest backticks inside a code span** — it cannot parse, and the
  result is raw `**` on screen in the viewer.
- Versions must be unique and descend down the file. Entries predating this
  convention carry a date but no time — do not backfill.

## Deployment

**Read `deploy.md` before you deploy.** The loop:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "describe the change"
git push origin main

gh run list --limit 1   # the "Wedding Planner" pipeline; ~3.5 minutes
# then Portainer: "Pull and redeploy" (manual, or via webhook)
```

That push is the deploy. `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` builds the app, checks
the changelog, builds the production image and publishes `latest`,
`v<version>` (the topmost `CHANGELOG.md` heading) and `sha-<short>` to GHCR. A
pull request gets the same build as a check and publishes nothing, so a broken
commit cannot reach the registry.

Building by hand is a **fallback only** — Actions down, or an image needed from
a working tree that is not pushed. It overwrites whatever CI published:

```bash
docker build --cache-from ghcr.io/soccerbeats/weddingwebsite:latest \
  --target production -t ghcr.io/soccerbeats/weddingwebsite:latest \
  -f docker/Dockerfile .
docker push ghcr.io/soccerbeats/weddingwebsite:latest
```

The Dockerfile runs `npm run build` internally — no local build step needed.

### Environment variables

Set in the Portainer stack (or `docker/.env` for local compose runs):

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/dbname
ADMIN_PASSWORD=securepassword
# optional — signs the admin cookie; defaults to ADMIN_PASSWORD
JWT_SECRET=a-long-random-string
NODE_ENV=production
POSTGRES_USER=user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_DB=dbname
# optional — RSVP email notifications (nodemailer over SMTP)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=you@example.com
SMTP_PASS=app-password
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=couple@example.com
# optional — honeymoon flight lookup ("Fill in from schedule" on a travel leg).
# A RapidAPI key subscribed to AeroDataBox; its free plan is 1 request/second.
FLIGHT_API_KEY=
FLIGHT_API_HOST=aerodatabox.p.rapidapi.com
# optional but recommended — OpenStreetMap's geocoder refuses callers whose
# User-Agent does not identify a contactable operator (it 403s, which surfaces as
# map search failing on the server while working locally).
GEOCODER_USER_AGENT=WeddingWebsite/1.0 (you@example.com)
# optional — your own geocoder / routing server instead of the public ones
NOMINATIM_URL=
OSRM_URL=
```

**Every one of the optional variables must also be listed in the compose file's
`environment:` block to reach the container.** Until v0.9.51 only `DATABASE_URL`,
`ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `NODE_ENV` were, so a key set on the Portainer stack silently
never arrived — which is how the documented SMTP settings could never have
worked. They are written `${VAR:-}` so an unset one is an empty string rather
than a compose warning, and each feature reports itself unconfigured in the UI.

### Pre-deploy checklist

- [ ] TypeScript compiles; build finishes without errors or warnings
- [ ] No console errors in the browser
- [ ] Admin panel features tested (incl. uploads/display)
- [ ] Public pages tested, responsive on mobile
- [ ] Authentication flow and WIP toggles verified
- [ ] Image pushed, pulled and redeployed in Portainer, live site checked

### "Document everything"

When Austin says **"document everything"** after a feature, do all five, in
order, before the commit:

1. Update `README.md` — the relevant section, with step-by-step usage
2. Add a **version-stamped** `CHANGELOG.md` entry (rules above)
3. Update the **GitHub wiki** — it is where the documentation actually lives
   (the README is a front page). Clone it, edit, push:
   `git clone git@github.com:Soccerbeats/weddingwebsite.wiki.git` — branch
   `master`. Touch every page the change makes wrong, not just the obvious
   one: a feature usually lands in `Features`, its own area page, and
   `Architecture` or `Troubleshooting` if it added a mechanism or a failure
   mode. It went 25 versions stale once because nothing on this list said to.
4. Update the vault at `/home/austin/vault/wiki/entities/wedding-website.md` —
   the feature's section, a dated bullet under **Decisions & History**, and
   any new API endpoints, config keys or data formats
5. Commit and push to GitHub
6. Nothing else — the push publishes the image (see *Deployment*)

## Architecture

### Where things live

- `src/app/` — public pages (`/`, about, our-story, wedding-party, schedule,
  photos, rsvp, registry, work-in-progress) and `/admin/*` (dashboard, rsvps —
  which also manages the guest list — photos, timeline, schedule, faqs,
  wedding-party, nav-cards, home, about, seating, finances, registry,
  honeymoon, changelog, settings, color, wip-control, login)
- `src/app/api/` — public routes (rsvp, photos/[filename], guest-verification,
  nav-cards, auth/*, **honeymoon/feed** — the token-authenticated calendar) and
  admin CRUD per feature. The honeymoon portal's own routes beyond the generic
  `[resource]` CRUD: `geocode`, `routes`, `weather`, `flight`, `rate`, `ics`,
  `seed`, `archives`, `shares`, `price-checks`, `upload`
- `src/lib/` — `db.ts` (pg pool), `financeDb.ts` and `honeymoonDb.ts` (the
  runtime schema owners), `changelog.ts` (parses CHANGELOG.md for the in-app
  viewer), `demoSeed.ts` (the fictional-wedding generator), `seating.ts` (the
  seating chart's pure logic, shared by the canvas and the list view and covered
  by `check:seating`), `seatingExport.ts` (the export as a document — what is on
  the page, the tallies, the CSV and the one-page fit maths — also covered by
  `check:seating`), `dietary.ts` (what people cannot eat, and where that answer
  lives), and the honeymoon portal's pure logic, all covered by
  `check:honeymoon`:

  | Module | Owns |
  |---|---|
  | `honeymoon.ts` | Types, categories, distances, dates, search, `.ics` building |
  | `honeymoonJourneys.ts` | Journeys: grouping legs, layovers, **day placement from dates** |
  | `honeymoonToday.ts` | Trip mode: which day is today, the day's plan, emergency numbers |
  | `honeymoonTimeline.ts` | A day as a sequence; hops; time-zone arithmetic; the day's *shape* for the timeline view (the stacked bar, the clock) |
  | `honeymoonBudget.ts` | The trip total, currency conversion, deadlines, completeness |
  | `honeymoonChecks.ts` | Conflicts, stay stretches, due-date buckets, packing |
  | `honeymoonPlaces.ts` | Import/export, region filing, nearby, day suggestions |
  | `honeymoonHours.ts` | OSM `opening_hours`, which answers *unknown* rather than guessing |
  | `honeymoonSun.ts` | Sunrise/sunset (NOAA), zone helpers |
  | `honeymoonMarkdown.ts` | The small Markdown notes use, parsed to a tree not HTML |
  | `honeymoonFetch.ts` | The outbound services and their caches (server only) |
  | `honeymoonCalendar.ts` | The `.ics` both calendar routes serve |
  | `honeymoonShare.ts` | Share tokens (server only) |
  | `honeymoonExport.ts` | The dashboard's offline copy: the whole payload as one self-contained HTML file |
  | `honeymoonFiles.ts` | The Files tab: a document's kind from its filename, the expiry warnings (six months after the trip for a passport), folders, search |
- `public/config/*.json` — file-based content config, written by the admin at
  runtime (`site.json` settings/colors/dates, `photos.json`, `timeline.json`);
  a Docker volume, not in git
- `database/init.sql` — the schema (see conventions above)
- `docker/` — the Dockerfile, the dev/prod/demo compose stacks, `.env.example`
- `scripts/` — the check scripts and seeds, run via the package.json aliases

### Data storage

- **File-based (`public/config/`)** — content that is easily editable and
  portable: site settings, colours, dates, photo metadata, timeline.
- **PostgreSQL** — relational data and forms: `rsvps`, `guest_list`,
  `wip_toggles`, `donations`, `vendors`, the `finance_*` suite (settings,
  categories, items, subitems, payers, purchases, contributors, receipts),
  seating (`floor_plans`, `floor_plan_room`, `floor_plan_walls`,
  `seating_tables`, `seat_assignments`), and the `honeymoon_*` suite:
  - the plan — `trip`, `regions`, `places`, `days`, `stops`, `travel`,
    `journeys`, `todos`, `notes`, `categories`
  - the paperwork — `bookings` (polymorphic over place / leg / stop / journey),
    `documents`, `comments`, `price_checks`
  - the sharing — `shares` (tokens for the read-only link *and* the calendar
    feed), `views` (named filter sets), `archives` (a whole trip as JSON)
  - the caches — `routes` (OSRM), `weather` (Open-Meteo), `rates` (FX)

### Key mechanisms

- **Auth** — one admin password (`ADMIN_PASSWORD`); a JWT session in an
  HTTP-only cookie, signed with `JWT_SECRET` (falls back to `ADMIN_PASSWORD`;
  with neither set, nothing signs and nothing verifies — never a default
  secret). All of it lives in `src/lib/auth.ts`; import from there rather than
  re-deriving the key. Sessions last 2h and are re-issued by the middleware
  when under an hour remains. `src/middleware.ts` protects `/admin/*` **and
  `/api/admin/*`, for every method including GET**, rate-limits the public
  write endpoints (`/api/auth/login`, `/api/rsvp`, `/api/guest-verification`;
  `src/lib/rateLimit.ts`), and **gates the WIP/hidden public pages
  server-side** (it asks `/api/wip-status`, cached 15s). Three GETs are allowlisted as public in that file —
  `site-config`, `registry-items`, `timeline` — because the nav, the RSVP form,
  the registry page and our-story read them; they return content that is
  already on public pages. **Adding to that list makes something
  world-readable.** Enforce new rules there rather than in handlers: one place
  covers every route, including the ones added later. (Until v0.9.35 the API
  half was missing entirely and the whole admin API accepted anonymous reads
  and writes.)
- **Config writes** — anything that changes `public/config/site.json` goes
  through `updateSiteConfig(mutator)` in `src/lib/config.ts`: one queue, an
  atomic write-then-rename. Editors POST only the keys they own to
  `/api/admin/site-config` (which merges shallowly, `pageBgColors` one level
  down). Never `writeFileSync` the config directly — two tabs saving together
  used to lose each other's keys, and a truncated file silently reset the site
  to its template defaults. `writeJsonAtomic()` is there for `photos.json` and
  `timeline.json`.
- **Uploads** — every route that writes into or deletes from `public/photos`
  uses `src/lib/uploads.ts`: `rejectUpload()` (image extensions, 25 MB),
  `safeImageFilename()` (basename, timestamped) and `resolveInPhotos()` (refuses
  anything that escapes the directory). The photo route serves SVG as a
  download, never `image/svg+xml`.
- **Outbound fetches of admin-typed URLs** (`fetch-meta`, the geocoder's
  short-link expander) go through `src/lib/safeFetch.ts`, which refuses
  private/loopback addresses on every redirect hop and caps the body.
- **Photo serving** — admin uploads land in the `public/photos` volume;
  `GET /api/photos/[filename]` serves them (with thumbs and resizing). Every
  `<Image>` uses `src=/api/photos/…` plus `unoptimized` (required for volume
  photos). The public gallery shows **only the hearted photos**, in the `order`
  the admin's drag-and-drop set — both fields live in `photos.json`, which the
  gallery reads through `GET /api/photos` (never `/config/photos.json`: Next
  lists the `public/` folder once at boot).
- **Docker** — multi-stage (deps → dev | builder → production), standalone
  output, non-root `nextjs:nodejs` (UID 1001). On every boot `init-db.sh`
  waits for Postgres, then applies `database/init.sql`. Volumes hold
  `public/photos`, `public/config` and the postgres data — runtime uploads
  live in volumes, never in the image.
- **The demo instance** — runs the same image as production with
  `DEMO_MODE=true`, so nothing is built for it. That flag makes the instance
  **read-only and login-free**: `src/middleware.ts` answers every write under
  `/api/` without running it, and opens `/admin` to everyone. `src/lib/demo.ts`
  refuses the flag unless the database in `DATABASE_URL` is named `demo`, so a
  production instance cannot fall into it — keep that fail-safe if you touch
  either file. The browser asks `/api/demo-status` rather than reading a
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_` mirror, because two sources of truth for "is it safe to drop
  writes" is not a trade worth making.
  The "Demo Instance" workflow (push to main) publishes the **seeder** image:
  the Dockerfile's `seeder` stage, under its own name. The stack's one-shot
  `seed` service runs on every `up` (`SEED_ALWAYS=true`) — safe *because* the
  instance is immutable, and it is how the demo gains data for features that
  shipped since it was last deployed. A hand run is still
  `npm run seed:demo -- --yes-wipe`. Updating the demo is the same act as
  production — pull the image, redeploy the stack. Nothing in CI touches the
  server: a draft of that workflow SSHed in to save the redeploy click, which
  would have let anyone able to push to this public repository run commands on
  the box that also hosts production.
- **Seating chart** (`/admin/seating`) — two views over one plan, switched in
  the page header:
  - **Canvas** — a React Flow (`@xyflow/react`) surface: draw the room, drop
    tables, drag guests from `guest_list` into seats. The guest list is a
    **Guests / Hide guests** toggle in the toolbar: a 288px column from `md` up
    (open by default), and below it a drawer over the canvas that starts closed
    and is positioned *under* the toolbar — as a full-width flex sibling it
    pushed the toolbar off-screen and there was no way to close it again.
    Toggling refits the view. On a phone the minimap is hidden and the toolbar
    scrolls sideways. **Where each chair sits, and how big the table is, is
    `tableLayout()` in `src/lib/seating.ts`**, not the node: the seat list walks
    clockwise — round from the top, rectangular along the top left to right and
    back along the bottom, head along the top only — so the reorder dialog's
    order *is* the arrangement, and the table grows until every chip fits at its
    measured width (`seatChipWidths()` in `seatChip.ts`, a canvas measurement in
    the chip's font — keep it in step with `SeatChip`). **A table's stored x/y is
    its anchor, not the node's corner**: the page places the node at
    stored − `layout.anchor` and saves position + anchor on drag, so a table that
    grows stays put — a long table at its top-left corner, a round one at its
    centre (132px in from the stored point, where it always was). (Until v0.10.5
    every long table put all its seats underneath and a round table never grew.)
    **A long table can be turned** (`seating_tables.rotation`, clockwise degrees;
    a round one ignores it): the grip at its end previews every 15° step through
    `setNodes` and saves on release, and the stored point is the table's *own*
    top-left corner turned with it, so a turn has to move it —
    `positionAfterTurn()` — or the table would pivot on that corner. The chips
    stay upright and are spaced by their reach *along* the table, which is why a
    table on its end is short.
  - **List** (`SeatingListView.tsx`) — the same plan as a roster, grouped **by
    table** (rows are people, with an "Not seated" block on top) or **by guest**
    (rows are whole parties). Multi-select (click, ⌘/Ctrl-click, Shift-range,
    per-group select-all; shift-click *is* the range, so it narrows as well as
    widens, and ⌘-shift adds a second range), drag rows onto a group to seat or
    free them, and a
    bulk bar: move to table, unseat, and behind the ⋯ — swap two people, gather
    split parties, auto-seat into free chairs. Double-clicking a seat renames
    it, which is how `Anna's guest 1` becomes a person. **Every group starts
    collapsed** — thirteen open tables is a thousand-row page — and a search or a
    filter overrides that for whatever it matched, or the search would look
    broken. **Below 768px this is
    the view the page opens on** (decided in an effect after mount, never during
    render — the server has no viewport), the filters fold behind a Filters
    button, and the drag hints are hidden, because touch has no HTML5 drag: on a
    phone the workflow is select, then the bulk bar.
  A party takes `party_size` chairs, minus anyone who answered "not attending";
  split parties are flagged in both views. **All of that logic lives in
  `src/lib/seating.ts`, not in either view** — `partyAttendees`, `buildPartySeats`,
  the `plan*` functions and `seatingIssues` — so the canvas and the list cannot
  drift apart, and `check:seating` covers it. Every change goes through
  `POST /api/admin/seating/assign`, whose `{ deletes, seats }` shape applies a
  bulk move in one transaction.
- **Who can be seated** — `guest_list` rows, and only those. `guest_list.kind`
  is `guest` for everyone invited and `couple` for the two getting married: the
  couple are one ordinary household of two (bride as `guest_name`, groom in
  `party_members`), which is why seating them needed no seating code at all. The
  `kind` filter is what keeps them out of the invitation statistics, the mailing
  export and the RSVPs tab — **add it to any new count over `guest_list`**, or
  the couple silently inflate it. A row with `kind IS NULL` predates the column
  and is a guest.
  **Vendors are not in `guest_list`** and never take a chair: their own `vendors`
  table, their own tab, one row per person, with a `dietary` JSONB in the same
  `DietaryEntry` shape an RSVP stores so the same editor and the same counting
  code work on both.
- **The seating export** (`src/lib/seatingExport.ts`, `SeatingExportModal`,
  `SeatingExportSheet`) — one pure module, one dialog, one sheet component drawn
  twice: shrunk as the dialog's preview and portalled to `<body>` as the thing
  that prints. A preview rendered by different code from the printout is a
  preview you cannot trust, so **do not fork them**.
  - The preview lays out at `A4_CONTENT_WIDTH` (703px — A4 *inside* its 12mm
    margins), not at 794px. It laid out at 794 until v0.9.96, which is why a
    preview that looked like one page could print as two.
  - **Counts-only is fitted to one page**: `fitScale()` measures the sheet and
    shrinks it, floored at 60% — below that it reports the page count instead of
    pretending. The scaling uses `zoom`, **not `transform: scale()`**: a
    transform leaves the element's flow height untouched, so the page breaks in
    the very place the scaling was meant to prevent.
  - `NO_RESTRICTION_LABEL` names the no-restriction bucket ("Chicken") in one
    place, so the table lines, the counts sheet and the kitchen tile cannot
    drift. It is the constant to change when an entrée question lands (SEAT-1 in
    `docs/parkinglot.md`).
  - **A chair is not a plate.** `DIET_CODES` are the five restrictions (they
    modify a plate); `MEAL_CODES` are `KID` and `NOM` (they decide it), and
    `ALL_DIET_CODES` is what every tally, chip, legend and CSV column iterates —
    **iterate that one**, or a new answer silently vanishes from the sheet.
    `Tally.plates` is `total − NOM` and is what `grandTotal()` and the kitchen
    tiles count; `total` is chairs. Handing a caterer the headcount when someone
    is not eating orders one plate too many.
  - `dietCodes()` returns `['NOM']` and nothing else for a not-eating entry, so
    the exclusivity holds even for a row written by an older release or by hand
    — the editors enforce it too, but they are not the last line.
  - Dietary answers reach a chair **by name** and nothing sturdier — a seat
    stores `display_name`, an RSVP files an answer under the name that answered.
    That is why a rename in the guest list carries to both.
- **Honeymoon portal** (`/admin/honeymoon`) — a private planner *and* a trip
  companion: map (Leaflet, four base layers), day-by-day itinerary with a
  timeline, **journeys** (a whole ticket with its legs, layovers and one booking),
  places/stays/excursions with a booking vault and a budget, guide notes, a
  phone-first offline **Today** view, and per-country emergency details.
  Ten tabs (Overview, Today, Itinerary, Map, Places — with Stays and Excursions
  as its segments on their own URLs — Travel, Checklist, Files, Guide, Settings),
  each under a `TabToolbar`. **Files** (`FilesTab.tsx`) is the only place travel
  documents live; Settings no longer has them. **Documents work offline because
  the Files tab and the Today view post the list of document URLs to
  `public/honeymoon-sw.js`**, which keeps exactly that list in its
  `honeymoon-files-v1` cache and serves `/api/photos/…` from it when the network
  fails. Until v0.10.1 the UI promised this and the worker never did it — if you
  touch either side, keep the message (`honeymoon-sw:files`) and the cache name in
  step. The trip calendar (`DateRangePicker`) is **locked on `pointer: coarse`**
  until *Change dates*, and only a press on a day captures the pointer — capturing
  every press is what broke its month arrows. **Below 768px** the shell sets `html.hm-compact`, which
  hides the site nav and the admin bar (see `globals.css`); the portal draws one
  slim bar and `MobileTabBar` along the bottom, the itinerary shows one day at a
  time, and its timeline is `DayAgenda` (vertical) instead of the bar or clock.
  Admin-only, with two deliberate exceptions that are *not* under `/admin`:
  `/honeymoon/<token>` (a read-only share link) and
  `/api/honeymoon/feed?token=…` (a subscribe-able calendar). Both authenticate
  on a `honeymoon_shares` token — a calendar client cannot log in — and both
  answer 404 for unknown, revoked and expired tokens alike.
- **Outbound services in the portal** — OSRM (driving times and road geometry),
  Open-Meteo (forecast and climate normals), open.er-api.com (exchange rates) and
  AeroDataBox (flight schedules, the only one needing a key). All cached in
  Postgres (`honeymoon_routes`, `honeymoon_weather`, `honeymoon_rates`), all
  routed through `src/lib/safeFetch.ts`, and **none of them load-bearing**: every
  value starts null and every view renders as it did before while it is missing.
  Geocoding is Nominatim with Photon behind it, because Nominatim will 403 a
  caller it cannot identify.

## Code style

- Components PascalCase (`PhotoGallery.tsx`); pages and API routes lowercase
  (`page.tsx`, `route.ts`).
- TypeScript: interfaces for data structures, no `any`, prefer explicit
  function components over `React.FC`. In Next 16, `params` in dynamic routes
  is a **Promise**.
- Tailwind: order layout → sizing → spacing → colours → effects; semantic
  spacing (`gap-4`, `p-6`), arbitrary values sparingly.
- API routes: proper HTTP methods, consistent `{ success: true }` /
  `{ error: 'message' }` JSON, try-catch, validate input before processing.
- Theme: the accent is a CSS variable on `:root` (`--accent: #D4AF37`,
  `--accent-light: #F4E5C3`, `--accent-dark: #B8941F`), stored in
  `public/config/site.json` and edited in the admin's settings.

## Common tasks

**New public page** — 1) `src/app/<page>/page.tsx`, 2) add to the links array
in `src/components/Navigation.tsx`, 3) add to `publicPages` in
`src/app/admin/wip-control/page.tsx`, 4) editor page in
`src/app/admin/<page>/page.tsx`, 5) nav item in `src/app/admin/layout.tsx`.

**New file-based config** — JSON file in `public/config/`, an API route under
`src/app/admin/` that reads/writes it with `fs`, ensure the directory exists
before writing, volume-mounted in Docker.

**Images** — always:

```tsx
<Image src={`/api/photos/${filename}`} alt="..." fill unoptimized className="object-cover" />
```

## Debugging

- **Photos not displaying** — is the file in the volume
  (`docker exec <web> ls /app/public/photos`)? Does the URL use the
  `/api/photos/` prefix? Does the component have `unoptimized`?
- **Build errors** — Next 16 `params` is a Promise; `ENV` in the Dockerfile
  must be `ENV KEY=value`.
- **Data not persisting** — are the volumes mounted? Are permissions
  `nextjs:nodejs`? Does the API route create the directory before writing?
- **Auth issues** — is `ADMIN_PASSWORD` set? Is the cookie present (HttpOnly,
  SameSite)? Does the middleware redirect unauthenticated users to
  `/admin/login`?

## Known limitations

Photos and the database live in Docker volumes — backups are a separate
strategy. No CDN. A single admin user, no roles. All images are served
`unoptimized` for volume compatibility.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
