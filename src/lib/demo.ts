/**
 * Demo mode.
 *
 * The public demo instance lets anyone walk in and touch everything — no login,
 * every admin page open — because nothing they do is allowed to persist. That is
 * a very useful mode and a catastrophic one to enable by accident: writes that
 * quietly go nowhere are the worst failure this system can have, because nothing
 * reports an error and the loss only shows up later.
 *
 * So the flag is deliberately hard to turn on by mistake:
 *
 *   1. It is **off unless explicitly set**. A missing or misspelled variable
 *      leaves a normal, fully writable instance. Every default fails towards
 *      "this is production".
 *   2. It also requires the database to *look* like the demo's. `DEMO_MODE=true`
 *      pointed at a database whose name is not the demo's is treated as a
 *      misconfiguration and ignored — the case where someone pastes the demo's
 *      environment onto the real stack.
 *   3. When it refuses for that reason it says so loudly at boot, because a
 *      silently-ignored DEMO_MODE would be just as confusing in the other
 *      direction.
 *
 * Set it only in `docker/docker-compose.demo.yml`.
