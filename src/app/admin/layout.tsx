/**
 * Server wrapper around the admin shell.
 *
 * Exists only to override one piece of metadata: the manifest link. iOS uses
 * the linked manifest's `start_url` when you Add to Home Screen, ignoring
 * whatever page you were actually on — so with a single site-wide manifest,
 * adding /admin produced an icon that opened the public home page. Pointing
 * admin pages at a second manifest variant gives that icon `start_url:
 * '/admin'` instead. A nested layout's `manifest` field wins over the root's.
 *
 * The interactive shell stays in AdminShell (a client component, which cannot
 * export metadata).
