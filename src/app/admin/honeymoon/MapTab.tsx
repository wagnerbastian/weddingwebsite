 * Deliberately not a card: the tab inside it already renders its own cards, and
 * a panel-shaped box around them reads as a box in a box. All this adds is a
 * label, a way out to the full tab, and its own scrollbar — the columns scroll
 * independently, which is the whole point of having the map pinned between them.
