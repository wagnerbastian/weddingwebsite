 * the initial HTML even though it is a client component.
 *
 * Markers are divIcons rather than image pins, which sidesteps Leaflet's
 * well-known broken-default-icon problem under bundlers and lets each category
 * carry its own colour without shipping seventeen PNGs.
 *
 * Pins are clustered. Framing Singapore and Bali together puts ~1,700 km on
 * screen, at which zoom 118 individual pins collapse into two unreadable blobs;
 * clustering turns those into counts that split apart as you zoom in. Clustering
 * is switched off while a day's route is displayed, where merging consecutive
 * stops would hide the very ordering the route exists to show.
