/**
 * Autosave for the admin panel's editors, and the status that replaces the
 * button they used to have.
 *
 * Every editor here had the same Save button and the same three bugs waiting
 * behind it, so the answer is one hook rather than nine copies. What it has to
 * get right:
 *
 *   - **Not saving on load.** Several editors normalise what they load — sorting
 *     it, filling defaults — so "has the state changed since mount?" is true on
 *     arrival and would write the file back for merely opening the page. React
 *     also double-invokes effects in development, which defeats the obvious fix
 *     of skipping the first run. So the trigger is the payload *differing from
 *     the one that was loaded*, which is immune to both and additionally means
 *     typing something and undoing it costs no request.
 *   - **Not one request per keystroke.** Typing a sentence is one save.
 *   - **Not two requests at once.** A change made mid-request is queued and sent
 *     after it, so the last thing typed is the last thing written rather than
 *     whichever response happens to land last.
 *   - **Saying so when it fails.** With no button, the status is the only thing
 *     on screen that answers "is what I typed safe?".
